## Videos of Previous Live Sessions

To see videos of live sessions covering most of this material, see the [Anyscale Academy](https://anyscale.com/academy/) page or visit the [Anyscale YouTube! channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7L1tZw52rtgmIB4fr_f40w/playlists).

## Tutorial Setup

Read the appropriate setup section that follows, then jump to [**Launching the Tutorials**](#user-content-launching-the-tutorials).

## Setup for Anyscale Academy Hosted Sessions

There is nothing you need to setup, as the hosted environment will provide everything.

However, consider cloning or downloading a release of the tutorial notebooks and supporting software from the [Academy repo](https://github.com/anyscale/academy), so you have a local copy of everything.

> **Tip:** If you modify any notebooks during the hosted session, make sure you download them to save those changes.

## Setup for a Local Machine

> **Note:** Ray support for Windows is new. See [these release notes](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/releases/tag/ray-0.8.7) for details.

Follow these instructions to use the tutorials. Note that some commands can take a while to finish.

Clone the [Academy GitHub repo](https://github.com/anyscale/academy) or [download the latest release](https://github.com/anyscale/academy/releases).

Now install the dependencies using either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or `pip` in your Python environment. We recommend using Anaconda.

### Which Python Version?

Python 3.7 is recommended. While Ray supports Python 3.6, there are known problem using _locales_ in that version and these tutorials. Specifically, the following code throws an error:

```python
import locale
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, locale.getlocale())
```

This tutorial doesn't manipulate _locales_ explicitly, but you may run into problems with your default locale.

While Ray supports Python 3.8, some dependencies used in `RLlib` (the Ray reinforcement library) are not yet supported for 3.8, at the time of this writing.

### Using Anaconda

If you need to install Anaconda, follow the instructions [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). If you already have Anaconda installed, consider running `conda upgrade --all`.

Run the following commands in the root directory of this project. First, use `conda` to install the other dependencies, including Ray. Then activate the newly-created environment, named `anyscale-academy`. Finally, run the provided `tools/fix-jupyter.sh` script to install a graphing library extension in Jupyter Lab and perform other tasks.

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate anyscale-academy
tools/fix-jupyter.sh
```

If you are using Windows, see the [**Fixing Jupyter Lab on Windows**](#user-content-fixing-jupyter-lab-on-windows) below for an alternative to using `tools/fix-jupyter.sh`.

Note that Python 3.7 is used. Ignore the similar-looking `environment-docker.yml` file. It is used to build Docker images.

You can delete the environment later with the following command:

```
conda env remove --name anyscale-academy
```

### Using Pip

If you don't use Anaconda, you'll have to install these prerequisites first:

* Python 3.7:
	* See notes above about problems with 3.6 and 3.8. Don't use 3.8, but 3.6 may work for you.
    * The version of Python that comes with your operating system is probably too old. Try `python --version` to see what you have.
    * Installation instructions are at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    * Windows で仮想環境
        * `py -3.7 -m venv academy`
        * `.\academy\Scripts\activate` ホームディレクトリからでないとアクティベートできない？
* Pip: A recent version - consider upgrading if it's not the latest version.
	* Installation instructions are at [pip.pypa.io](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
	* 最新にしておく。 `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
* Node.js: Required for some of the Jupyter Lab graphics extensions we use.
	* Installation instructions are [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
	* インストールしておく。
* SWIG: Required for building dependencies.
	* Use the package manager of  your system (e.g. `apt` on Ubuntu, `brew` on MacOS) to install, or download [here](http://www.swig.org/download.html).
	* zip をダウンロードして展開 -> path を通す `$ENV:Path = "C:\Users\YOSHIKI\GitHub\academy\swigwin-4.0.2;" + $ENV:Path`

Next, run the following commands in the root directory of this project to complete the setup. First, run the `pip` command to install the rest of the libraries required for these tutorials, including Ray. Then, run the provided script to install a graphing library extension in Jupyter Lab and perform other tasks.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
tools/fix-jupyter.sh
```
Windows では、 `pip install holoviews` が足りない？

If you are using Windows, see the [**Fixing Jupyter Lab on Windows**](#user-content-fixing-jupyter-lab-on-windows) below for an alternative to using `tools/fix-jupyter.sh`.

### Fixing Jupyter Lab on Windows

The `tools/fix-jupyter.sh` shell script runs the following commands. If you are using Windows, run them yourself as shown here.

First, see if the following `pyviz` extension is installed:

```
jupyter labextension check --installed "@pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz"
```

If not, run this command:

```
jupyter labextension install "@pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz"
```

Finally, run these commands:

```
jupyter labextension update --all
jupyter lab build
jupyter labextension list
```

### Final Installation Notes

If you use Jupyter a lot, consider installing [Kite](https://www.kite.com/) on your machine and the Jupter Lab plugin for Kite. Installation and usage instructions are [here](https://help.kite.com/category/138-jupyterlab-plugin).

When you have finished working through the tutorials, run the script `tools/cleanup.sh`, which prints temporary files, checkpoint directories, etc. that were created during the lessons. You might want to remove these as they can add up to 100s of MBs.

> **Note:** A Windows version of this script is TBD.

## Launching the Tutorials

The previous steps installed [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), the notebook-based environment we'll use for all the lessons. To start run the following command in the project root directory:

```shell
jupyter lab
```

It should automatically open a browser window with the lab environment, but if not, the console output will show the URL you should use.

> **Tip:** If you get an error that `jupyter` can't be found and you are using the Anaconda setup, make sure you activated the `anyscale-academy` environment, as shown above.

## Troubleshooting and Further Information

See the [Troubleshooting, Tips, and Tricks](reference/Troubleshooting-Tips-Tricks.ipynb) notebook.

For details on the Ray API and the ML libraries, see the [Ray Docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/). For other information, see [ray.io](https://ray.io), including the [Ray blog](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray).

[Ray](https://ray.io) started at [U.C. Berkeley RISELab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/). It is now developed in artisanal, small batches at [Anyscale](https://anyscale.com).

## Building Docker Images

> **NOTE:** At this time, the Docker images only run on the Anyscale platform!!

Use the script `tools/make-docker-images.sh` to create two Docker images, `academy-base` and `academy-all`. Use the `--help` option to see the arguments and environment variables it uses. For example, to use a tagged GitHub release of the Academy code, `v1.2.3`:

```
$ tools/make-docker-image.sh v2.0.0-RC1 --docker-tag 2.0.0.1 --docker-tag latest
```

Using the Academy repo tagged release `v2.0.0-RC1`, this command creates two Docker images, each of which is has two "virtual" copies tagged `2.0.0.1` and `latest`. (The copies are identical, so no extra space is actually used. You specify as many as you want.) They are also uploaded to Anyscale's Docker Hub. If you omit the `--docker-tag` argument, the Git tag is used as the image tag, with the `v` removed.

One image is `anyscale/academy-base`, which has everything except the tutorials themselves. It has the required Anaconda environment setup and configured Jupyter Lab environment, etc. The `base` image takes a while to build, but it should only need rebuilding for each new Ray release. The Docker file used is `docker/Dockerfile-academy-base`. Note that a Conda environment is created in this build using `./environment-docker.yml`.

The second image is `anyscale/academy-all`, which is built upon `academy-base`. It has the tutorial materials and builds very quickly compared to `base`. The Docker file used is `docker/Dockerfile-academy-all`.

Use `all` or no arguments (the `make` targets) to build both images and push them to Docker Hub. _You must run `docker login --username ...` before building the `*-upload` targets described next._

Here are the "interesting" targets you might specify to fine tune what's done:

| Target          | Purpose |
| :-------------- | :------ |
| `all`           | Build both images and upload them to Docker Hub (default target). |
| `docker-images` | Build both images, but don't upload them. |
| `docker-upload` | Upload both images. Assumes they are already built. |
| `academy-base`  | Build and upload the `base` image. |
| `academy-all`   | Build and upload the `all` image. |

There are other options you can try to customize what happens. Use the `--help` flag to find out.

> **NOTES:**
>
> 1. When building releases, use `latest` in the list of `DOCKER_TAGS`. The `academy-live-events` repo uses this image tag by default for creating sessions!
> 2. The `make` rules are nontrival. Pass `-n` to print out the expansions of them if you are unfamiliar with `make` syntax or just want to see what commands would be executed.
> 3. If the Docker build errors out with code 137, first try cleaning old images and containers (`docker ps -a; docker rm ...` and `docker images; docker rmi ...`). Next try restarting Docker. What's most likely to work is to increase the memory allocated to the Docker process. On MacOS, use the _Preferences_ to do this. If that doesn't work, try increasing the swap and disk image sizes.

> **WARNING:** It took over a week for me to successfully create the first versions of these Docker images. JupyterLab configurations, in particular, are very fragile with regards to some of the animated graphics in _Ray Crash Course_. So, only modify the builds with great caution and test everything carefully!! Also, note that `environment-docker.yml` hard-codes Python 3.7.7. Using 3.7 causes runtime failures in the Anyscale platform!!!
